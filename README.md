# OrbitSim-v2.0
Basic 2D orbital mechanics simulator with GUI

This basic software is capable of computing and displaying an approximation of the orbit of one or more objects throug the eqation of motion.
The accuracity of the orbits displayed is based on the "Path Resolution" value, decreasing this value will increase the accuracity of the approximated orbit but also increase the time needed to compute every point of the orbit and the lag when moving the object.
